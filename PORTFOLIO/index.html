        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>Hello! I’m <strong>Nuh Abdi</strong>, a Self-taught programmer based in Ethiopia. I specialize in Web development(Html, Css, Javascript, Php, Django), App Development(Flutter), Game Development(C# in Unity), Telegram Bot building(python).<br>My journey in programming began back when I was 14yrs old, and since then, I’ve had the privilege of working on responsive websites, simple games on unity, Apps for the Community, intelligent telegram bots.

            <br>I believe in the power of working hard even if it seems impossible and not giving up, which drives me to create strong relation with my clients. My goal is to do flawless and creative projects.
            
            <br>When I’m not programming, you can find me watching anime or trading stocks. I’m always eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities.
